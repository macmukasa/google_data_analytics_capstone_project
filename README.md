## Introduction

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share program, which has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. The business has flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase annual memberships are referred to as Cyclistic members, and those that purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.
I assume the position of Junior data analyst working in the marketing team at Cyclistic. The team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently, in order to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Business Task
Utilise Cyclisticâ€™s historical bike trip data to derive analysis to understand the usage trends and behaviours of the 2 customer segments.
